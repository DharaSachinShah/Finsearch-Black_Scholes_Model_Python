END TERM REPORT FINSEARCH -- Option Pricing Models and their accuracy

# Finsearch-Black_Scholes_Model_Python
Team E7 of finsearch 

We created a Python script that assesses the accuracy of the Black-Scholes Model by comparing its calculated option prices to the real option prices derived from Nifty50  index options.

We took the data from NSE website as a csv file which contains different option types (put and call) and their price, interest rate, time etc. with these values, we calculated the option price and compared it to LTP (last traded price). This helped us to find the mean absolute difference in the option prices.
We have also done the graphical analysis by plotting the real and calculated option prices for call and put types. This helps us to visualize and understand the black scholes model.

The data and code is attached.
